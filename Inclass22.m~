%1. Consider the case of the auto-activating gene that we discussed in class
%today. Make a bifurcation diagram for this system by varying the
%activated transcription rate for three cases - in which 1, 4, or 8 copies of the
%transcripton factor are necessary to activate transciption. Comment on your
%results.

% In case 1, where only 1 copy of a transcription factor is needed to
% initiate auto-activation, two stable solutions are present. One of these
% is non-physical, with a negative concentration of the transription
% factor. This appears because the rate of decay is artificially positive
% and balances the rate of production, which is artificially negative. The
% second stable solution is real and represents the case where production
% outweighs degradation (or dilution). This occurs at all possible kb
% values if x is large enough, since basal expression occurs.

% In case 2, where 4 copies of the transcription factor are needed to
% initiate activation, two stable solutions and one unstable solution are
% present. The case where the basal expression balances the degradation is
% the first stable solution (no effective activation). The second stable
% solution occurs where kb becomes large enough so that auto-activation and
% basal expression added together balance degradation. kb has become large
% enough to sustain auto-activation at higher x concentrations. The
% unstable solution is the case where auto-activation is occurring, but
% degradation has become large, so the rates of low auto-activation plus
% basal expression balance the rate of degradation. A perturbation of
% higher x will promote more auto-activation, driving the solution up
% towards the upper stable solution. A perturbation of lower x will cause
% degradation to dominate, pushing the solution down towards the lower
% stable solution with no auto-regulation.

% In case 3, where 8 copies of the transription factor are needed to
% initiate activation, the same trends are seen as in case 3. However, the
% unstable solution only exists in a much shorter range of kd values. This
% is because when kd becomes large relative to ku, auto-activation

% 2. Make a similar diagram for the case of an autorepressing gene in the
% case that 2 copies are need to turn off the gene.
